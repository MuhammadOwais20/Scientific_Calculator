# 🧮 Scientific Calculator in C

## 📚 Project Overview

This is our first group-based project where we designed a **Scientific Calculator** using the C programming language. The calculator is capable of performing **20+ mathematical operations**, helping us explore and implement core computational logic without any graphical interface.

## 💡 Problem Statement

A standard calculator performs only basic functions and lacks advanced capabilities required in scientific and academic work. We aimed to develop a scientific calculator with extended functionality that supports operations such as logarithms, trigonometric calculations, derivatives, quadratic equations, and more—using structured and modular C programming.
