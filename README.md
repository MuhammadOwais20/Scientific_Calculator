# Scientific Calculator in C

A standard calculator performs only basic functions and lacks advanced capabilities required in scientific and academic work. We aimed to develop a scientific calculator with extended functionality that supports operations such as logarithms, trigonometric calculations, derivatives, quadratic equations, and more—using structured and modular C programming.
